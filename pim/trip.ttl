    <>     s:comment """This ontology is for use in describing trips,
such as business trips.
Trips connect where we are at a given point in time,
meetings which are part of the trip, and who pays for the trip 
or part of the trip.
They are useful for describing travel plans,
for working out expenses, and for categoizing photographs.
Trips do not in fact logically have to involve travel.
A trip could be used to collate expenses relating to an activity or event
at ones home base, or a set of photos taken at home etc.
