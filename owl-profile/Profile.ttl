     rdfs:comment "Note that, strictly speaking, OWL DL and OWL Full are not referred to, formally, as “profiles” by the OWL 2 Profiles specification. However, “each profile is defined as a syntactic restriction of the OWL 2 Structural Specification, i.e., as a subset of the structural elements that can be used in a conforming ontology,…” (see the OWL 2 Document Overview). In this sense, and for practical purposes, including a URI for OWL DL and Full is correct. Indeed, OWL DL can be seen as a sytactic restriction of OWL that is particularly well suited for OWL 2 Direct Semantics, whereas OWL Full is a “profile” without any syntactic restriction, and is usually associated with the usage of the OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics. Note also that there are no separate URIs for the 2004 version of OWL DL; OWL 2 DL, published in 2008 supersede that version. Nor is there a URI for OWL Lite." ;
