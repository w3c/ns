	by the OWL 2 Profiles specification. However, "each profile is defined as a syntactic restriction of the
	OWL 2 Structural Specification, i.e., as a subset of the structural elements that can be used in a conforming ontology,…"
	(see the OWL 2 Document Overview)
	In this sense, and for practical purposes, including URI-s for OWL Full and OWL DL is correct: OWL Full does not impose any restriction, whereas OWL DL
	can be seen as a sytactic restriction of OWL Full that is particularly well suited for OWL 2 Direct Semantics.
	Note also that there are no separate URI-s for the 2004 version of OWL Full and OWL DL; OWL 2 Full and OWL 2 DL, published in 2008 supersede
	that version of OWL. Nor is there a URI for OWL Lite.""" ;
